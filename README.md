# cmip6-global-lfca
Code and processed CMIP6 data associated with Wills et al. (2021, J. Climate)

For a cleaned up example of how to run LFCA (in Matlab or Python), please see github.com/rcjwills/lfca.

This repository contains the Matlab script cmip6_global_lfca_figures.m to create most figures in Wills et al. (2021, J. Climate). This requires the contents of the tools folder. The multi-taper spectra and coherence analysis scripts from Peter Huybers are also required for some figures and should be downloaded separately: https://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~phuybers/Mfiles/. 

Pre-processed data from the final 400-years of 35 different CMIP6 models' pre-industrial control runs is included in two .mat files, including the six LFCs/LFPs used in Wills et al. (2021, J. Climate), global-mean surface temperature (GMST), global-mean TOA radiative imbalance (GMTOA), Nino3.4, and the traditional PDO and AMO indices. 

Cleaned-up scripts demonstrating how to apply LFCA on an ensemble of CMIP data in structured directories will be uploaded before the final publication of Wills et al. (2021, J. Climate).
